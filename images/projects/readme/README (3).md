## How It Works:

The application utilizes a combination of OpenAI embeddings, Pinecone vector search, and a conversational interface to provide a seamless retrieval experience. When a query is made, the system:

1. Converts the query into embeddings.
2. Searches for the most relevant document sections using Pinecone's vector search.
3. Returns the answer along with citations and links to the source documents.

## Setup Instructions:

### Clone the Repository

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-nificent.git```

#### Install Dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Set Environment Variables

Create a .env file (see .env.example for reference) with the following variables:

```
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME
PINECONE_NAME_SPACE
OPENAI_API_KEY
PINECONE_API_KEY
GROQ_API_KEY
```

#### Create a Pinecone Index
Create a Pinecone index with the same name as `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`. Set it up with `dimensions=1536` and `metric=cosine`.
#### Data Ingestion
Place your PDFs in the pdf_data directory and run data_ingestion.py.
Run the Application

```
chainlit run src/app.py
```
